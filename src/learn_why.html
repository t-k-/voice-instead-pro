<h3>A letter from the author</h3>
<p>With the recent fast growing number of weekly users (reaching more than 100K already), I observe excessive usage frequency on one or two top-rated APIs. Please notice those APIs are free services and they are collected from the Internet. With the increasing number of users, their service becomes less stable due to heavy traffic, this greatly damages experience of all VI users. For examples, users may experience pause-in-the-middle problem, moreover, providers will potentially deny our frequent requests to particular API (one example is Amazon Polly Mathew).</p>
<p>Therefore, I decide to randomly distribute and constrain users to a limited set of choices among all available APIs, while at the same time offering option to <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/voice-instead/kphdioekpiaekpmlkhpaicehepbkccbf/">upgrade/subscribe</a> VI with a fee of $2.99 per year for those who want to access or heavily use any available API they prefer. By doing so, I believe it will greatly reduce the pressure of API servers and provide service with desired quality for those in need.</p>

<p>Voice Instead starts from a personal side project, it is introduced into Chrome Web Store from 2013, free of charge.
Since then, I invest hours of time fixing bugs and improving VI. Maintaining this software is not easy as it looks like, it actually involves a lot of efforts without paying. Please continue to support VI and the I will definitely be thankful if you are going to pay and subscribe this extension. This incentive is important for me to keep making Voice Instead better.</p>

Best regards,
